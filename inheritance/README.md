in this library 2 classes 
1. Restaurant:

   - the name of the restaurant 
   - the star rating for the restaurant
   - the price catagory
   - an arraylist for the reviews 
2. Reveiw: 
this class has 3 proprties :
   - the body which is the review it self
   - the rating for the restaurant you reviewed 
   - the name of the reviewer

and there is a method called `addReview()` where the user can add his review for a specific restaurant.
